### Maker Comment
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Sujith, and I built RFPgrep because I was tired of spending 30+ hours on every RFP response.

The worst part? I kept answering the same questions over and over, searching through old proposals for that perfect answer I wrote 6 months ago.

So I built an AI tool that:
1. Learns from your winning proposals
2. Automatically finds relevant content from your docs
3. Predicts your chances of winning
4. Helps your whole team collaborate

The magic moment is when you mark a project as "Won" and click "Learn from Win." The AI extracts your successful patterns and uses them for future responses.

I'd love your feedback! What features would make this even more useful for your team?

### Post 1: Launch Announcement
```
🚀 I just launched RFPgrep - an AI tool that writes RFP responses for you.

After spending 30+ hours on a single proposal (again), I decided to build something better.

Here's what it does:

📄 Upload your RFP document
🤖 AI generates tailored responses
📚 Uses YOUR company docs for context
🧠 Learns from your winning proposals
🎯 Predicts your win probability

The game-changer? When you win a deal, click "Learn from Win" and the AI extracts what made that proposal successful.

Next time, it writes MORE like your wins.

Early users are seeing:
• 60% faster response times
• 25% higher win rates

### Post 2: Pain Point Focus
```
Unpopular opinion: Most RFP responses are copy-paste jobs anyway.

So why are we spending 40 hours on each one?

The reality:
• 80% of questions are the same across RFPs
• Your best answers are buried in old proposals
• Nobody remembers what you wrote last quarter

I built RFPgrep to solve this.

It keeps a living library of your best answers and automatically matches them to new questions.

The AI doesn't make stuff up—it uses YOUR content.

Check it out: https://rfpgrep.com

### Post 3: Feature Highlight
```
New feature: AI that predicts if you'll win the deal 🎯

Just shipped Win Rate Predictions for RFPgrep.

Here's how it works:

The AI analyzes 5 factors:
1. Response completion (are questions answered?)
2. Response quality (length, approvals)
3. Time management (deadline buffer)
4. Team collaboration (assignments, contributors)
5. Historical performance (past win rate)

Then it gives you a probability score.

But more importantly: it tells you WHAT to fix.

"Your responses are too short" ➜ Add more detail
"Low team participation" ➜ Assign more questions
"Deadline risk" ➜ Prioritize critical sections

Try it: https://rfpgrep.com

### Post 4: Behind the Scenes
```
I built an AI that learns from your wins.

Here's the idea:

When you win a deal, your RFP response worked. Something about the tone, the detail, the structure—it resonated.

But that knowledge usually dies in a folder somewhere.

So I built a feature called "Learn from Win."

Click it, and the AI extracts:
• Your successful answer patterns
• The tone that worked
• The level of detail

Next time you answer a similar question, the AI references these winning examples.

Few-shot learning, but for sales proposals.

Early results: 25% win rate improvement.

### Post 5: Call to Action
```
If your team spends more than 10 hours on RFP responses...

You're doing it wrong.

I've watched sales teams burn entire weeks on a single proposal, only to lose to someone who submitted faster.

Speed matters. Here's how to get it:

1️⃣ Build an Answer Library
Save your best answers. Reuse ruthlessly.

2️⃣ Use AI wisely
AI writes the first draft. Humans add the story.

3️⃣ Learn from wins
Don't just celebrate. Document what worked.

4️⃣ Predict before you submit
Know your chances. Fix weak spots.

I built RFPgrep to do all 4 automatically.

- "Quick question about your proposal process"

### Email Body
```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company] responds to a lot of RFPs (saw you on [Source]).

Quick question: How many hours does your team spend per proposal?

I built a tool that's helping teams cut that time by 60% using AI.

The key insight: 80% of RFP questions are the same. We just forget where we answered them last time.

RFPgrep automatically:
• Finds your best past answers
• Generates new responses using your company docs
• Learns from your winning proposals

Would love to give you a demo—takes 15 minutes.

Here's my calendar: [Link]

🧵 I just launched an AI tool that writes RFP responses.

Here's what I learned building it:

1/ The biggest time sink in RFPs isn't writing. It's SEARCHING.

Finding that security answer from 6 months ago. Hunting for the case study that matches their industry.

AI can search 10,000x faster than you.

2/ RAG > Fine-tuning for this use case.

You don't want AI making stuff up. You want it finding YOUR content.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation = AI that searches your docs before answering.

3/ The magic is learning from wins.

When you win a deal, something about that proposal worked.

Click "Learn from Win" and the AI extracts those patterns for future use.

Few-shot learning for sales.

4/ Win prediction is possible.

5 factors predict proposal success:
- Completion rate
- Answer quality
- Timeline buffer
- Team collaboration
- Historical performance

We calculate this in real-time.

5/ Teams need to collaborate.

RFPs are team sports. SMEs, writers, reviewers.

Built-in comments, assignments, and version history.
